# I'm a big fan of Lucy from Peanuts
### The closest thing to a site where I have my work is my Etsy that I started as a side hustle over the summer.  Almost all the designs are my original work unless it looks directly traced like the Mr. Toad one or the Monster High ones.  I really need to make a portfolio.
